"""Utility helpers for the Kezan Protocol.

This subpackage is reserved for generic helper functions that do not
fit into a more specific module.  Currently it serves as a placeholder
for future utilities and provides a clear namespace for them.

# No utilities are defined yet.  The file exists to ensure that Python
